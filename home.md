# DigiByte Blockchain

Welcome to the DigiByte Blockchain Community Wiki! This space is dedicated to providing in-depth and unbiased information about the DigiByte Blockchain project. We aim to offer a comprehensive overview of DigiByte's technical specifications, its history, and its place within the broader blockchain ecosystem.

## What is DigiByte?

DigiByte is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to provide a secure, fast, and scalable environment for various use cases. Launched on January 10, 2014, with a genesis block that contained the message: "USA TODAY: 10/Jan/2014, Target: Data stolen from up to 110M customers," DigiByte has gained recognition for its commitment to decentralization and security.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Algo Consensus

DigiByte employs a unique approach to consensus by implementing multiple mining algorithms. This enhances security and decentralization by reducing the risk of a 51% attack.

### 2. DigiShield and MultiShield

DigiShield and MultiShield are mechanisms developed to adjust the difficulty of mining, making it more responsive to network changes, and mitigating the impact of large mining operations.

### 3. Segregated Witness (SegWit)

DigiByte was one of the early adopters of Segregated Witness (SegWit) technology, which improves scalability and transaction security. Serialized blocks support a maximum size of 4 MB (4,000,000 bytes).

### 4. UTXO Blockchain

DigiByte uses a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model for its blockchain, offering a solid foundation for secure and efficient transactions.

### 5. Issuance and Emission

DigiByte utilizes a block mining reward model, with an initial block reward of 72,000 DigiBytes, and an issuance that sees approximately a 1% reduction per month. The maximum supply of DigiBytes is capped at 21,000,000,000 (21 billion DigiBytes).

## Community-Driven Development

DigiByte has a vibrant and passionate community that actively contributes to its development. The project operates as an open-source endeavor, which encourages collaboration and transparency.

## Use Cases

DigiByte serves as a versatile blockchain, finding applications in various industries such as cybersecurity, secure data storage, decentralized applications (DApps), and more. The platform's speed and security make it a compelling choice for developers and businesses.

## Technical Specifications

- **Block Timing**: An expected block timing of 15 seconds.
- **Block Share**: An equal share of 20% per algorithm.
- **Max Block Size**: A maximum block size of 1 MB (1,000,000 bytes).
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Difficulty adjustment occurs every 1 block, with separate difficulty shares.
- **Address Formats**: DigiByte supports multiple address formats, including "D" for legacy addresses, "3" for multi-signature addresses, and "dgb1" for SegWit Bech32 addresses.
- **Denominations**: The plural form of the DigiByte cryptocurrency is "DigiBytes," with a ticker symbol of DGB and a currency symbol of Ɗ (Unicode: U+018A). The precision extends to 10⁻⁸, with subunits including mDGB (miliDigiByte, 1/1000), µDGB (microDigibyte, 1/1000000), and ɗSats (digiSatoshi, Digis, 1/100000000).
