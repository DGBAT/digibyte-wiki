# WIP - Contribution Guidelines

Hey!

So you are looking to contribute to the DigiByte Wiki?

-That's great news!

Let's get into it.

## Intro

First, let's quickly go through how the DigiByte Wiki works.

### Syntaxes
Generally speaking, there are three different syntaxes you can use when you create articles for the DigiByte Wiki.

* Plaintext
	* Contributing a `.txt` file.
* HTML
	* Contributing a `.html` file.
* Markdown
	* Contributing a `.md` file. (See [Documentation](https://wiki.digibyte.org/en/contribute/markdown-guide))
  
Using the MarkDown syntax is preferred, this is easy to read and quick to review and verify.

HTML works very well, but this should generally be avoid as this is a quite cluttering syntax and will be harder to read and review.

Plaintext is just that, plain text, this approach does not require you to learn anything of any additional syntaxes but also does not give you any formatting or rendering options to make it more visually appealing.
